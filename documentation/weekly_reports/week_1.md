# Week 1

This week I decided the topic of my project and wrote my [project specification](https://github.com/maizzuu/data-structures-lab/blob/main/documentation/project_specification.md)
document. I decided that I would only do a text UI. I also read the course material and studied the shunting-yard algorithm, as well as reverse polish notation. In addition, 
I checked out my friend's repository to see the structure of the repository. It would be nice if there was an example project where we could see the wanted
structure of the repository and how the documentation has been done etc.

I am not sure how to start a project of this size, I don't know whether I should have a separate "main" class or just a main.py file. Next week I hope to
have more understanding of the structure of my project and some crude classes ready. I also hope to have completely understood how the shunting-yard algorithm works.
