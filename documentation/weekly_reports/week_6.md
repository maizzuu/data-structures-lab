# Week 6

This week I didn't have much left to do, as I had all of my main functionalities ready. I did some small improvements based on the peer review I was given.
I mainly focused on documentation and added some more unit tests.

I only spent about 2 hours on the project this week. Next week I will do more improvements based on the next peer review.
