# Week 5

The most important thing I did this week was adding functions to the calculator. It was a little difficult and I had to do quite a lot of research to get everything to work. I had to do some changes to the program in general to get the functions to work. I also encountered some other bugs that I luckily managed to fix. I also did some smaller changes to make my code easier to understand and test, such as moving all error handling to the `Calculator` class. Another important modification was the separation of unit tests to their own files based on what class they were testing.

I also spent some time on documentation, I wrote a short user guide and added docstring to all the methods that were missing it. Also, some documentation had to be updated after I had changed some exception names.

Next week I will write the final instructions and finalise the documentation. All core functionalities have now been implemented.

This week I have spent approximately 10 hours working on my program.
