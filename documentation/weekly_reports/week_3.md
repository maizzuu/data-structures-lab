# Week 3

This week I separated the Shunting-Yard algorithm to its own class, wrote the algorithm that calculates the final result, and added a lot of documentation to my classes. I made the Shunting-yard algorithm more clear and easy to read by separating it to multiple methods. I also realised that my algorithm didn't understand decimal numbers or negative numbers so I fixed that. My test coverage is now 100% according to htmlcov, but for some reason codecov says it's only 98%. I also added some more error messages, for example one for adjacent operators and ones for "." being the first or last character in the expression.

This week I have paid a lot of attention to pylint's suggestions, for example I learnt to use the "enumerate" -function, which proved very useful. I had some trouble with pushing to Github after my laptop's public SSH key changed, so I had to spend a few hours fixing that. Overall, everything went surprisingly well this week and I really enjoyed working on this project.

Next week I will work on adding variables to my program, and maybe even start adding functions. I will also have to catch up on documentation, because some of this week's code is still undocumented. This week I spent about 10 hours in total doing this project.
