# Week 4

The most important thing I did this week was adding variables to the calculator. I also wrote more tests and
improved the quality of the code. I tried my best to fix the problem where the CI fails when I define the type of a parameter as "str | None", but could not find a solution, so now all parameters have pre-defined types other than those that can be either a string or None. This week I also started writing my implementation and testing documents. My test coverage is still 100%.

I didn't learn anything significant this week, which was probably due to my lack of time to spend working on this project.
However, I still feel I was successful in improving the project.

Next week I will work on adding functions to the calculator and probably change the way variables work at the same time,
because I have realised the current method, while simple, is not the best. I worked for approximately 5 hours this week.
